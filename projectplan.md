# Premium Prompt Library - Phase 1: Core Components Setup

## Project Overview
Implementing a premium prompt library with a dedicated page structure, clean navigation, and basic API integration. The system will build upon the existing authentication and API infrastructure.

## Phase 1 Requirements Analysis
Based on the current codebase:
- ✅ React frontend with vanilla JS (no build system)
- ✅ Authentication system working perfectly 
- ✅ API endpoints functional: GET /api/prompts, DELETE /api/prompts/[id]
- ✅ Database fields mapped correctly in existing code
- ✅ Main App.js has existing popup library modal (line 429-482)

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Create LibraryPage.js Component
- [ ] Create new dedicated page component (not popup)
- [ ] Clean, premium layout structure with proper spacing
- [ ] Header with title and navigation breadcrumbs
- [ ] Grid container for prompt cards
- [ ] Integration with existing auth system
- [ ] Loading and error states

### Task 2: Create PromptCard.js Component  
- [ ] Simple card displaying: title, created date, prompt type
- [ ] Clean styling with subtle shadows and borders
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- [ ] Click handlers placeholder for future actions
- [ ] Hover effects for premium feel

### Task 3: Update Navigation in App.js
- [ ] Add "Library" navigation option
- [ ] Route handling using simple show/hide approach
- [ ] Maintain existing popup functionality as fallback
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation for back to main app

### Task 4: API Integration
- [ ] Connect LibraryPage to existing GET /api/prompts endpoint
- [ ] Display real user data in PromptCard components
- [ ] Loading state with spinner
- [ ] Error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Empty state when no prompts exist

### Task 5: Basic CSS Styling
- [ ] Premium card design with subtle shadows
- [ ] Responsive grid layout
- [ ] Typography hierarchy matching existing design
- [ ] Hover states and transitions
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive approach

### Task 6: Testing & Integration
- [ ] Verify all navigation works smoothly
- [ ] Test with real database prompts
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works
- [ ] Check authentication integration
- [ ] Verify no console errors

## Technical Considerations

### File Structure
```
/components/
  ├── LibraryPage.js (new)
  ├── PromptCard.js (new)
  ├── UserMenu.js (existing)
  └── MigrationDialog.js (existing)
```

### API Integration
- Use existing `apiService.getPrompts()` method
- Handle pagination (start with first 50 prompts)
- Maintain existing error handling patterns

### Navigation Strategy
- Add library state to App.js main component
- Use simple conditional rendering (similar to existing `showLibrary` state)
- Keep existing popup as backup functionality

### Styling Approach
- Follow existing brand colors and styling patterns
- Use existing CSS classes where possible
- Add new premium components with consistent design language

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ LibraryPage displays actual prompts from database
2. ✅ Navigation between main app and library works smoothly  
3. ✅ PromptCard components are responsive and visually appealing
4. ✅ No console errors or authentication issues
5. ✅ Loading and error states work properly
6. ✅ Code is clean, documented, and maintainable

## Next Phases Preview
- Phase 2: Enhanced interactions (favorites, search, filters)
- Phase 3: Advanced prompt management features
- Phase 4: Premium animations and micro-interactions
