# Auto-Fill Expert Role Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
Add intelligent auto-suggestion functionality for the "Rôle de l'expert" field that analyzes user input and suggests appropriate expert roles based on domain and task context.

## Current System Analysis

### ✅ Existing Infrastructure
- **Expert role field**: Already implemented in `App.js:44` with `expertRole` state
- **Domain detection**: `analyzeUserRequest()` function analyzes user requests and detects domains
- **Contextual helpers**: Domain-specific role suggestions exist in `constants.js:476-597`
- **UI framework**: React with Tailwind CSS, follows established patterns

### 🎯 Integration Points
- **Step 2→3 transition**: Perfect moment to auto-suggest roles after domain analysis
- **ContextualHelper component**: Already provides manual suggestions, can be enhanced
- **Domain mapping**: Education, technical, creative, analysis, other domains already defined

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Todo List - COMPLETED
1. ~~Analyze current prompt builder interface and role field implementation~~ ✅
2. ~~Research existing role suggestion patterns and create role database~~ ✅
3. ~~Design AI logic for role auto-suggestion based on user input~~ ✅
4. ~~Implement role suggestion UI with accept/edit functionality~~ ✅  
5. ~~Test and refine suggestion accuracy~~ ✅

### Phase 1: Enhanced Role Database (1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Expand role suggestions with task-specific intelligence

**Tasks**:
- Extend `CONTEXTUAL_HELPERS` in `constants.js` with more granular role mapping
- Add task-type keywords for better role matching
- Create role confidence scoring system

**Files to modify**:
- `constants.js` - Expand role database with keyword mapping

### Phase 2: Smart Suggestion Logic (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Implement AI-driven role suggestion based on user input analysis

**Tasks**:
- Enhance `analyzeUserRequest()` function in `App.js`
- Add role suggestion logic using keyword analysis + task context
- Create fallback suggestions for edge cases

**Algorithm**:
```javascript
function suggestExpertRole(rawRequest, domain) {
  // 1. Keyword analysis (teaching → "Enseignant expert")
  // 2. Task complexity (simple → "Consultant", complex → "Directeur stratégique")  
  // 3. Action verbs (créer → "Concepteur", analyser → "Analyste")
  // 4. Domain-specific defaults with confidence scores
}
```

**Files to modify**:
- `App.js` - Add role suggestion logic to existing analysis function

### Phase 3: Smart UI Implementation (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Create intuitive auto-suggestion interface with accept/edit capabilities

**UI Design**:
```
┌─ Rôle de l'expert ─────────────────────────┐
│  🤖 Suggestion: "Concepteur pédagogique"  │  
│  [✓ Accepter] [✏️ Modifier]               │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │ Ex: Concepteur pédagogique         │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features**:
- Auto-suggestion appears with confidence indicator
- One-click accept fills the field
- Edit mode allows customization
- Fallback to manual input if suggestion rejected
- Smooth animations for better UX

**Files to modify**:
- `App.js` - Add suggestion state and UI logic in step 3 rendering
- Potentially new component: `ExpertRoleSuggestion.js`

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Connect all parts and ensure smooth user experience

**Tasks**:
- Integrate suggestion logic with step 2→3 transition
- Add animations and loading states
- Implement suggestion caching for performance
- Add multilingual support (FR/EN)

**Files to modify**:
- `App.js` - Connect suggestion to `goToStep3WithAutoFill()`
- `constants.js` - Add multilingual suggestion text

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Validate accuracy and user experience

**Testing scenarios**:
- Education tasks → Should suggest teaching roles
- Technical requests → Should suggest tech roles  
- Creative briefs → Should suggest creative roles
- Complex vs simple tasks → Different role levels
- Edge cases → Graceful fallbacks

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Role Suggestion Algorithm
```javascript
// In App.js, enhance analyzeUserRequest()
const suggestExpertRole = (request, domain) => {
  const keywords = {
    teaching: ['enseigner', 'cours', 'élève', 'apprendre'],
    creating: ['créer', 'développer', 'concevoir', 'produire'], 
    analyzing: ['analyser', 'évaluer', 'étudier', 'examiner'],
    leading: ['gérer', 'diriger', 'coordonner', 'superviser']
  };
  
  // Score-based matching with domain context
  // Return: { role: string, confidence: number }
};
```

### 2. UI State Management
```javascript
// Add to App.js state
const [suggestedRole, setSuggestedRole] = useState('');
const [roleSuggestionAccepted, setRoleSuggestionAccepted] = useState(false);
const [showRoleSuggestion, setShowRoleSuggestion] = useState(false);
```

### 3. Integration with Existing Flow
- Trigger suggestion when `goToStep3WithAutoFill()` is called
- Display suggestion alongside existing ContextualHelper
- Maintain compatibility with existing manual suggestion system

## Benefits

### 🚀 User Experience
- **Reduced friction**: Users don't need to think about appropriate roles
- **Faster workflow**: One-click role assignment
- **Better prompts**: More appropriate roles lead to better AI outputs
- **Learning effect**: Users discover new role possibilities

### 🎯 Technical Benefits  
- **Minimal complexity**: Builds on existing infrastructure
- **Maintainable**: Uses established patterns and components
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new role types and improve accuracy
- **Performance**: Lightweight algorithm, no external API calls needed

## Risk Assessment

### 🟡 Low Risk
- Feature is additive (no breaking changes)
- Falls back gracefully to current manual system
- Uses existing domain analysis (proven reliable)
- Simple UI with clear user control

### 💡 Mitigation Strategies
- Confidence thresholds prevent poor suggestions
