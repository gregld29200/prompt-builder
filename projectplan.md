# Custom Icons Integration for Process Section

## Project Overview
Integrate 4 custom icons into the "Comment Ã§a fonctionne ?" (How it works?) process section, replacing the current numbered circles while maintaining the existing design system and animations.

## Analysis of Current Structure
- Section uses a 2x2 grid layout with cards
- Each step has a `.step-icon` class with 80px circular background
- Current styling includes:
  - Alternating gradient colors (accent and gold)
  - Hover effects with scale and rotation
  - Numbers displayed as text (1, 2, 3, 4)
  - Circular design with shadows

## Todo List

### Phase 1: Implementation
- [ ] Replace numbered text with custom icons in HTML structure
- [ ] Add proper CSS styling for icon images within circular containers
- [ ] Ensure icons are properly sized and centered
- [ ] Maintain existing gradient backgrounds and hover animations
- [ ] Test icon visibility and contrast against backgrounds

### Phase 2: Optimization
- [ ] Implement proper fallback for loading states
- [ ] Ensure responsive behavior is maintained
- [ ] Add proper alt text for accessibility
- [ ] Test across different screen sizes

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Verify all animations still work correctly
- [ ] Test hover states with new icons
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling across all 4 steps
- [ ] Validate visual hierarchy remains intact

## Design Requirements
- Maintain the circular background and current styling
- Keep existing hover animations (scale and rotation)
- Ensure icons work well with gradient backgrounds
- Consider icon visibility and contrast
- Maintain responsive behavior
- Preserve the premium design aesthetic

## Implementation Strategy
The approach will be to:
1. Replace the number text with img elements for each icon
2. Style the images to fit within the existing circular containers
3. Ensure proper sizing and centering
4. Maintain all existing CSS classes and animations
5. Add appropriate filtering or styling to ensure good contrast

This approach minimizes code changes while achieving the desired visual enhancement.
